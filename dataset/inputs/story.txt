"The Bamboo and the Oak"

Grow, grow, grow — the bamboo waited.
Day after day, week after week, month after month — it waited.
Sun came, rain came, storms came — it waited.

The oak tree beside it laughed.
"I grow tall, I grow strong, I grow fast," said the oak.
"I rise, I rise, I rise," it boasted every day.

The bamboo stayed in the soil.
Wait, wait, wait — it stayed.
"No leaves, no height, no sign," said the oak.
"Slow, slow, slow — you will never grow."

The bamboo whispered, "Wait."

Year one — no growth.
Year two — no growth.
Year three — no growth.
Year four — no growth.
Year five — it shot up.

Tall, tall, tall — higher than the oak.
Fast, fast, fast — stronger than the oak.
Firm, firm, firm — deeper than the oak.

The oak was surprised.
"How?" it asked.
"I prepared," said the bamboo.
"While you showed off, I rooted deep.
While you rushed, I rested strong.
While you climbed, I waited long."

Seasons came, storms came — the oak broke.
The bamboo bent, the bamboo stood, the bamboo lived.

Moral:
Growth takes time. Rushing leads to ruin. Patience builds power. Quiet strength wins in the end.
